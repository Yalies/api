<h3>A better directory of the student body!</h3>
<p>Yalies is an redesigned version of Yale's official <a href="https://students.yale.edu/facebook">Face Book</a>, which provides contact information for Yale students. It displays the same data that is shown on the Face Book and <a href="https://directory.yale.edu">Yale Directory</a>, but with improved design, user interface, and security.</p>
<!--
<p>Yalies also provides an API that allows programatic data fetching without any scraping needed. The API has been used by <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/12/03/40-2-percent-of-returning-student-athletes-take-leaves-of-absence-this-fall">Yale Daily News, students in S&DS 315 and CPSC 490, and by student projects like <a href="https://coursetable.com">CourseTable</a>, <a href="https://ypost.app">YPost</a>, <a href="https://ship.wtf">Ship</a>, and more.</p>
